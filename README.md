# TC5044 MLOPS - Team 25
# Overview
### The opportunity presented in this document lies in the lack of an adequate system for the classification and selection of apartments in the United States of America. However, a detailed study is available that includes key apartment characteristics such as location, price, size, among others, allowing for a more in-depth and structured analysis. The objective is to develop a model that enables the visualization of the best price for renting an apartment based on the characteristics from the dataset available.
# The dataset used in this project is Apartment for rent classified https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified
